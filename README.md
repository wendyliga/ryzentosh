## What doesn't Work
- This motherboard offers 2 lan port, 1 gigabit and 2.5 gigabit. on this configuration, the 2.5 gigabit lan port have been recognized on the OS, but no connection what so ever when connected.
- Fan SMC
- Virtualization like Docker,  ~~VirtualBox 6.1 or VMWare Fusion 12.1~~
- when open Photos/photo picker (i sync icloud photo), the system will freeze, the cursor will still move, music that playing on the background still continue to play, other hackintosher find the same problem here https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/photos-app-makes-system-freeze.251513/
